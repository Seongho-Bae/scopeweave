## 2026-06-02 - Add CSP Header and secure ID Generation
**Vulnerability:** Weak randomness when creating task IDs and lack of protection against XSS exfiltration.
**Learning:** `Math.random` is an easily predictable random source, and static applications without CSP allow scripts to run from unexpected domains and exfiltrate data.
**Prevention:** Always use `crypto.randomUUID()` when available in browser environments, and provide strong Content-Security-Policy headers on the entry `index.html`.
