## 2026-06-02 - O(N^2) Bottleneck in task rendering
**Learning:** Checking for children tasks with `state.tasks.some` inside a visible tasks render loop (`renderTaskRow`) causes an O(N^2) operation, making the UI very slow for large amounts of rows (e.g. 5000+).
**Action:** Pre-compute a `Set` of parent IDs in `renderAll()` and pass the boolean `hasChildren` down to `renderTaskRow`. This changes the O(N) lookup in every row to an O(1) Set access, reducing rendering bottlenecks significantly while preserving existing behavior.

## 2025-05-31 - O(N²) Performance Bottleneck in getVisibleTasks

**Learning:** `getVisibleTasks()` filters visible items by checking the expansion state of all ancestors for each task using `findTask(parentId)`. Since `findTask` is an O(N) array search and `getVisibleTasks()` runs on every render, this creates an O(N²) bottleneck that freezes the UI on larger project plans.

**Action:** When performing multiple lookups by ID inside loops (especially during render cycles), always construct an O(1) `Map` or dictionary first. Replaced `findTask(parentId)` with a local `taskById` Map lookup to drop the complexity to O(N).
