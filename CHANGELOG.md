## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Added companion dependency-review and OSV workflows so Strix
  manifest-only findings can be verified against authoritative PR-head
  checks.
- Added workflow ownership regression coverage so central review
  workflows stay inherited from `ContextualWisdomLab/.github`, not copied
  into this repository.

### Changed

- 데이터 테이블의 반복되는 액션 버튼에 컨텍스트 정보(작업명)를 포함한 명시적인 ARIA 레이블을 추가하고, 유효성 검사 에러를 폼 필드에 연결하여 접근성을 개선했습니다.
- Centralized OpenCode Review, Strix Security Scan, PR Review Merge
  Scheduler, failed-check explanation, and coverage evidence ownership in
  `ContextualWisdomLab/.github`, removing repository-local workflow,
  script, and requirements copies.
- Documented Kubernetes/IaC as follow-up work rather than a current
  blocker for this static app.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-04-20
